### React State  
* A object that holds component data    
* state is dynamic way of passing data  
~> only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time  
* determine how component behave  
~> create dynamic component  

### Working with state  
* set App state with `getInitialState`; es5 only  
~> will get initial state for App  
```javascript
// App component
getInitialState: function() {
    return {
      fishes: {},
      order: {}
    }
  },
```
~> App will have fishes and order obj inside `state`  
```javascript
App.state === {fishes: {}, order: {}}
```

~> call setState to set new obj inside component state, 
passed in obj that change to scale up performance  
```javascript
addfish: function(fish) {
  var timestamp = (new Date()).getTime();
  
  //update state; fishes obj
  this.state.fishes['fish' + timestamp] = fish;

  //set state
  this.setState({ fishes: this.state.fishes })
},
```

* to call method from parent component  
~> need to pass in that method as prop from parent to child component  
```javascript
//Parent component
addFish: function(fish) {
  //...
},
render: function() {
  return (
    <ChildComponent addFish={this.addFish} />
  )
},
```
```javascript
//Child component
someMethod: function() {
  //call passed down method from parent
  this.props.addFish(fish);
},
render: function() {
  return (
    //pass into another child component
    <DeeperChild addFish={this.props.addFish} />
  )
}
```

> use slat operator to pass all props to child component  
```html
<ChildComponent {...this.props} />
```
